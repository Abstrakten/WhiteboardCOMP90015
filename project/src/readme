The WhiteBoard1.2 is not complete yet, but it shoulb be fine to implement other works. The GUI are built by SWING and AWT.
The drawing shapes are build by graphics and graphics2D.

The WelcomeWindow class is mainly targets to collecting state and username information, 
e.g. "Sean" "Client"

The InputAddrWindow is aims to collecting the IP and HOST address, the user object of this
particular user is created by this clss, it is created after the connection established, and before
the WhiteBoard object created. 
I suggest send the user object to server and storing it in a list, it may helpful
