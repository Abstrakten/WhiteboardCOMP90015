We, the project group, have all worked together on creating the distributed whiteboard. However, in order to avoid doing the same work twice, every group member had an area that they were primarily responsible for. Kasper worked on the RMI for the drawings, and did general code review, bug fixing during the project. Marc worked on the RMI for the Chat component and User Management Functionality. Navnita worked on the GUI, User Management Functionality and the Report. Xin created the GUI and worked on the User Management Functionality.
