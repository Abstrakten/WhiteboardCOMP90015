\section{Chat Functionality}
The chat functionality in the system works exclusively through the RMI implementation. By utilising the RMI registry method \texttt{broadcastMessage}, a client asks the server to broadcast a given message to everyone, including the client itself.
The \texttt{broadcastMessage} method calls the \texttt{retrieveMessage} method on each client, a function which retrieves the message the server was asked to broadcast.
