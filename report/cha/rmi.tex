\section{RMI}
The RMI components are split into two packages, one for server and one for client.
Each package contains two classes, a driver and a base class, and a interface.
The driver classes are solely responsible for establishing connections.
In the case of the server this means creating the registry, and in the case of the client connecting to said registry.

The methods contained in the interface and the base class, which implements the interface, are used to pass information through the server to all clients.
This includes the chat messages and the drawboard, as well as management functionality such as kicking a client from the whiteboard collaboration.
